# Password-Generator
Homework Assignment #3

Our password generator is a great tool if you would like a random password created with a spesific length and certain types of characters! Once you confirm which kinds of characters you would like in your password, the generator will take those groups of characters and randomly pick the password including at least 1 of each type of selected character. Please note the minumum password length is 8 characters!

If you do not prompt a password length equal or longer than 8 characters our HTML will prompt you to enter another password length.

Our password generator operates in your web browser!
